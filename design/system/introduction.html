                        <p class="description">The goal of Semantic UI is to narrow the divide between how we create meaning personally, through language, and how we construct meaning for computers.</p>
                        <p class="description">
                        Semantic UI is built around a very different premise, that the real bottleneck in computer programming are humans, and that the best way to advance the web isn't solely providing better institutions for learning programming, or even making more refined tools for existing programmers, but more importantly removing the technical barriers that separate programmatic meaning from human meaning.</p>
                        <p class="description">
                        Semantic provides several ways to modify UI elements. For big projects that rely on building a personalized brand-aware visual language, site themes allow you to modify the underlying variables powering Semantic UI, as well as specify alternative overriding css. Site themes are portable between projects, and affect the compiled framework code.</p>
<p class="description">
For smaller projects, projects with quick deadlines, or for those who prefer not to get into front end coding, packaged themes are great for borrowing from other open source designs in the field.</p>
<p class="description">
For either project type, an important place to start customizing Semantic is the site.variables file, the variables file which all other variable files inherit from.</p>
