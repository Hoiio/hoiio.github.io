    <!-- Timelog -->
    <div class="docs-section" id="timelog">
        <span class="time">Duration: 5 hours</span>
        <h6 class="docs-header">Time Logs</h6>
        <p>TimeLog is the app for recording the amount of a worker's time spent on each job. Employee have to use it for check-in and check-out via a device (e.g. designed to integrate with iPad) everyday. It does use for payroll, client billing, and increasingly for project costing, estimation, tracking and management.</p>
        <span class="docs-sub-header">Business Scenario</span>
        <p>Company A is in the retail business. So they have many retail stores in Vietnam. They have permanent staffs in different stores. But sometimes, they need help from Company B to get part-time staffs for their stores. Therefore in a store, it could consist of Company A's staffs as well as part-time staffs provided by B. It is ideal for both types of staffs to check in and check out using the same iPad in a store.</p>  
        
        <span class="docs-sub-header">Use case</span>
        <p>In each store, a manager of company A must check timesheet of part-time staffs everyday. It’s caused by the request from manager of company B who also review and keep track of what their staffs done in client’s stores. Timesheet may record the start and end time of works.</p>

        <span class="docs-sub-header">Here are some actions took by manager of company A:</span>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Approval</strong>: if the timelog is definitely right, manager makes an approval.</li>
                <li><strong>Decline</strong>: if wrong, manager deletes it.</li>
                <li><strong>Modified</strong>: If there has a wrong time point (e.g. staff checks in 10 minutes early than start to work), manager could edit the time log (e.g. by adding more 10 minutes.)</li>
                <li><strong>Missing</strong>: A staff forgot to check out when he ended his work shift. While reviewing timelogs today, the manager found out that there was a missing timelog of this staff. Then manager decided to keep this log as pending status and finished approving or rejecting others. Tomorrow this staff comes back and reports to manager the exact time he leaved out of store yesterday, the manager searchs name of staff and views detail time log of staff. Finally, he finds where time point is missing and adds a new timelog.</li>
            </ol>


        <span class="docs-sub-header">Noted</span>
        <ul>
            <li>With permanent staffs, manager of company A doesn’t need to do that everyday; all time logs are automatically saved in database of company A.</li>
            <li>Manager of company B logs into TimeLog Admin Dashboard to view all staffs who already reviewed and approved by company A.</li>
        
        </ul>

        <span class="docs-sub-header">Delivery</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Visualize use case and submit 1 user flow to folder <code>UX Team / Interaction</code>. User flow includes 4 actors (store manager of company A, store manager of company B, permanent staff, part-time staff).</li>
            <li>The use flow should be submitted in JPG format. The technique is completely free (drawing, computer, rough draft, etc.) and please follow the naming convention: <code>Interaction_TimeLog_YourFullName.jpg</code></li>
        </ul>
